GitHup Page: https://monsara.github.io/burger-and-3d-cube/

Task: 
1. Reproduce the "burger" button on the oggo.ch site (not the whole menu, just the button):
- The 3 bars which change length when the mouse is hovered
- Which turn into a cross on click
- And which return to the initial state with one more click
Only use CSS / Vanilla JS, no image or SVG

2. Display a square in the center of the screen, the height of which is 50% of the height of the screen.
- This square must be filled with some image
- On click, it turns over with a 3D effect (180 degree rotation)
- And on the other side of the square appears a video clip that runs in a loop

Both cases must work cross-browser and cross-device.
